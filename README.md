# AntiMsVirus-Ps

### STATUS: WORKING
- This program is able to disable the Microsoft Anti-Virus, however, due to development issues it was not tested in Safe Mode until later, it, is COMPLETE OVERKILL and does the task 10 times over, though thats nice too B).  

## DESCRIPTION
Microsoft Anti-Malware in Windows 10 onwards is turned off by manually going into Ms AV settings, but the user must do this EVERY TIME they boot up, and even then, there are relating processes still present, and the service is not able to be disabled in services. AntiMsVirus-Ps is a tool to, shut down and close, the Microsoft Anti-Malware, in Windows 10, it is focused on locating and terminating processes that are related to Microsoft's anti-malware services or applications ("Mp*.*" and "MsMp*.*"). The reason you would want to do such things, is because some people believe its better to have passive protection ran once a month as a, scheduled or manual, task, when other maintenance is also done; in short, having something continually run to check for virus, defeats the point of an anti-virus in its classic sense.

## REQUIREMENTS
- Windows 10/11
- Windows Powershell or Powershell Core.

### USAGE
* You should not use this program, unless you are NEVER EVER intending to use Microsoft Anti-Virus.
1. Create a restore point, this may be useful later if experiencing issues, so you can revert changes. 
2. On Windows 10v1903-11, you must first boot into Safe Mode, type "safe mode" into the start menu. 
3. When Safe Mode boots up, then you need to run the batch `AntiMsVirus.Bat` with Admin rights.
4. Try some of the options on the menu, then restart and see, or just go through them all in order.
5. Utilize your choice of Security software on the computer, I advise passive protection ran monthly.

## DEVELOPMENT
- Not really going to happen, but heres the potential plans... 
1. Options to delete the defender folder, after setting the defender folder permission (is this safe?).
2. Make sure all Outputted text is in correct formatting regarding, spaces and dots.
3. Consistency in error reporting, sometimes it prints to screen only, sometimes it uses the log too.
