# AntiMsVirus-Ps

### STATUS: ALPHA
- Wont take long, will be done today...

### DESCRIPTION:
In short, a tool to, shut down and close, the Microsoft Anti-Malware, in Windows 10, that seems to turn itself back on, it is focused on locating and terminating processes that are likely related to Microsoft's anti-malware services or applications (as indicated by the name patterns "Mp" and "MsMp").  

### PHILOSOPHY
Its annoying now I got my custom rainmeter (upcoming), that continually reminds me there is something running in the background, and its to do with viruses I dont have, and it takes up i/o continually, potentially lagging my system while I am running fallout 4, and thats on top of, search indexer and the security cameras. I prefer to keep the installers I use, I insist on the offline installers, and I just reinstall the trusted software I have when I reinstall the OS. I am my own virus scan, I know what the processes are supposed to do, I know what is supposed to be there and not, or I research it, I know my system and how it works. Why do I need something running, to protect me from something, when the servers have this kind of software, and probably more up-to-date?!?
